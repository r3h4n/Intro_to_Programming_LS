## Write a program that iterates over an array
## and builds a new array that is the result of 
## incrementing each value in the original array
## by a value of 2. You should have two arrays at
## the end of this program, The original array and
## the new array you've created. Print both arrays 
## to the screen using the p method instead of puts.

original_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
new_arr = [ ]

original_arr.each do |num| 
     number = num + 2
  new_arr.push(number)
end

p original_arr
p new_arr
